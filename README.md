## What is it?
KESTD-Ronin is a open source, lightweight, experiment friendly and cross platform game engine developed by KerboGames.

## What is the usage?
The engine and the integrated editor "AutoTec" can be used to create fully features 3D apps, simulations and games.
The engine is designed to be very easy to use and flexible - hence "experiment friendly", because 
it is also often used to test algorithms, rendering techiques or physics.
But you can also modify it, create your own variation or even use it as base to create your very own engine.

The main engine is written in modern C++ 20.
For general and gameplay scripting C++ or the very flexible Lua language can be used.
